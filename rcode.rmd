I wrote some pretty basic R code that analyzes iTunes libraries. I included this as a proof of concept, it's not the prettiest, nor is it the best R code ever, but it gets the job done to show what can be done.
 ```{r hello}
 summary(songs)
 ```

## Showing Findings

Here's a very primitive plot of genre vs play count. I could have played with it more but really we're proving that it can be done, not showcasing my R ability.

```{r foo,echo=FALSE}
with(songs,plot(songs$tracks.Genre, songs$tracks.Play.Count))
```
